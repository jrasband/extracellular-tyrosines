#+title: extracellular-tyrosines
A collection of scripts to extract and plot information about extracellular tyrosines from the [[https://www.uniprot.org/][UniProtKB]] protein database.
* Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Python packages =json=, =sys=, =requests=, =csv= (can be installed with =pip=)
* Explanation
=extracellular-tyrosines.py= takes the csv files =topHits= and =PSMData= (peptide spectral match data) as input and outputs a csv for each div with a row for each accession containing the following information: accession, name, gene, number of extracellular tyrosine residues, number of extracellular amino acids, total number of amino acids, peptide spectral match.

=plot.py= takes one of the div output files from above as an input and creates a plot.
